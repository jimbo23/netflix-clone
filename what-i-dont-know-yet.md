What I don't know:

1. serverAuth, getSession() fn from next-auth
2. properly migrate db in mongodb with prisma
3. SWR vs react-query
4. getServerSideProps
5. getServerSession() vs getSession()
6. diff between getting session with API call from client side vs getting session thru getServerSideProps
7. test in Navbar the difference between `fixed vs absolute`
